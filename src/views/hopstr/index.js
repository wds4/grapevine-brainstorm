        <p>
          If each follow counts as one hop, how many hops does it take to get from one npub to
          another? Hopstr harnesses the power of the FOSS neo4j graph database, including the neo4j
          graph data science library, to calculate your Follows Network quickly and efficiently. It
          can also calculate the shortest path from any npub to any other npub almost
          instantaneously.
